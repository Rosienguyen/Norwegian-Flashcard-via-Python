# Norwegian-Flashcard-via-Python

This is a project to learn Norwegian (A2) through flashcards in Python. 
All the conversations in the book `PÃ¥ Vei` (2018) are added here to learn. 
The card can be run sequentially at the first stage to go through all the sentence in order. 
Or it can be run randomly to test the vocab/ word choice/ grammar
