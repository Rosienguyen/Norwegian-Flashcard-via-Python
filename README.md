# Norwegian-Flashcard-via-Python

This is a project to learn Norwegian (A2) through flashcards in Python. <br>
All the conversations in the book `PÃ¥ Vei` (2018) are added here to learn. <br>
The card can be run sequentially at the first stage to go through all the sentence in order. <br>
Or it can be run randomly to test the vocab/ word choice/ grammar.  <br>

# Instructions
After cloning/download the repository to your computer, you can run the file `flashcard.py` in your IDE/Terminal. <br>
Make sure that the directory is the path to the repository/folder.<br>
In Terminal, you will type this `python flashcard.py`<br>
After that, type the lesson you wanna study. i.e: 16 and press ENTER <br>

You'll see a card like this <br>
