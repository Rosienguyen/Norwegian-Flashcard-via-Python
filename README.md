# Norwegian-Flashcard-via-Python

This is a project to learn Norwegian (A2) through flashcards in Python. <br>
All the conversations in the book `PÃ¥ Vei` (2018) are added here to learn. <br>
The card can be run sequentially at the first stage to go through all the sentence in order. <br>
Or it can be run randomly to test the vocab/ word choice/ grammar.  <br>
